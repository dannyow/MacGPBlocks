# Mac GPBlocks

This is my attempt to convert GPBlocks SmallVM into a Xcode project, easy to run and debug on macOS.

The original source code is here https://bitbucket.org/john_maloney/smallvm/src/master/


## Prerequisties 

To build the app first you need to install:

```
brew install sdl2
brew install cairo
brew install portaudio
brew install jpeg
```
